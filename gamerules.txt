INITIAL GAME SETUP
Begin the first day of the game on May 13, 1746. Place your Inquisitor
Token at All-Hallows-The-Great (✝). Have a Beast Token and Rumor
Tokens ready. Record all investigations in your Notebook.
Each round begins with I. The Beast Approaches.
I. THE BEAST APPROACHES
1. Roll 1d8 and find that location number on the map.
2. If the location has a Rumor Token, place the Beast Token at that
location (if not already on the map). The BEAST has arrived!
3. Otherwise, if the location does not have a Rumor Token, place one
at that location.
4. If the BEAST is on the map, roll 1d6. If the result is 5 or 6, the BEAST
moves one location closer to you.
5. If the BEAST is in the same location as you, a surprise HUNT is
triggered! See Hunting the Beast (p. 12).
Locations may contain more than one rumor token, but each Investigate
action only removes one (1) rumor token at a time.
Be cautious when in the same location as a rumor token. The BEAST can
arrive in that location, and will immediately trigger a hunt. If you are
unprepared, this can be deadly

II. TAKE ACTIONS
Choose any two (2) actions from the following list. You may take the
actions in any order, and may take the same action twice:
� MOVE: Move your Inquisitor Token to an adjacent
location connected by a white line.
� INVESTIGATE: Remove one (1) Rumor Token from
your location, and draw a card from the deck. Use the Codex
Inquisitorum (p. 15) to add a detailed Unverified Rumor
about the BEAST to your Notebook.
� VERIFY: When you are at All-Hallows-The-Great (✝), roll
1d6 for each Unverified Rumor in your Notebook. If the
result is a 5 or 6, cross it out as a false rumor. Otherwise,
mark it as a Learned Secret. Sketch pictures of Wards,
Weapons, and the BEAST, based on what you have learned.
� HUNT: If you are in the same location as the BEAST you
may perform a hunt. See Hunting the Beast (p. 12).

III. BEGIN THE NEXT DAY
Does the BEAST still live? The next day begins! Repeat the steps starting
with I. The Beast Approaches. The game continues until either you or
the BEAST are dead.

HUNTING THE BEAST
When you and the BEAST are in the same location:
1. Gain one d6 for each Ward (♠) or Weapon (♣) Learned Secret (not
rumor) in your notebook, up to a maximum of 5d6.
2. If you have no dice, take 1 Wound and skip to Step 4.
3. Roll the dice and use the single lowest value rolled: 1-2: You have
slain the beast; 3-4: The beast survives, and you take 1 wound; 5-6: The
beast is unharmed, and you take 2 wounds.
4. For each new wound you receive, mark one Wound Box (|) on the
map. When all three (3) wound boxes are full, you have died and the
game ends in defeat.
5. If you survive the Hunt, log the encounter in your notebook, and
continue the game.
Hunts can be triggered in one of two ways, either (1) by being in the same
location as the BEAST during I. The Beast Approaches or (2) by taking
the Hunt action during II. Take Actions.
Unconfirmed rumors do not assist in the hunt. Be sure to verify them at
All-Hallows before attempting a hunt.
Harm to the BEAST is not cumulative. You must slay the beast based on
your single lowest value rolled in Step 3 above.
